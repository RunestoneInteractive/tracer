# Tracer

This is a simple web service for generating python tutor / CodeLens traces for books built in PreTeXt or Runestone.

## Requirements

If you want to run your own then you are going to have to install the docker images for
generating traces in Java and C/C++

You can get these from: https://github.com/bnmnetp/OnlinePythonTutor.git
